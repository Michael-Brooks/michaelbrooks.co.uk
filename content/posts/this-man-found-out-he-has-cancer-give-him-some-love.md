description: "This month has been so weird for me. I walked into my workplace on the first of May to find out I'm being made redundant with a few colleagues due to targets not being hit. It didn't shock me, and I wasn't upset by this. I understood the company was hitting a rocky patch. However, I didn't expect this to happen, especially at the time it did."

Today I went onto YouTube and found a video from someone I'm subscribed to. I haven't watched his videos in a while, but this one caught my eye as it was titled "Well this sucks". Curiosity got the better of me, and I had to take a look. He talks about recently opening up with mental health and struggles to find tell us his news. He gets to a point where he tells us, and it's testicular cancer. Fuck.

He then goes onto to explain his visits and then, later on, says both will have to be removed. He won't be able to have kids and he doesn't know how to tell his family or his wife. To me, this is absolutely heartbreaking. A genuinely kind and caring person who shows his interests online has been hit with this terrible news.

What really breaks my heart is the fact him and his wife wanted kids, and now they can't have any, it's horrific and I feel we need to let him know we're here for him.

## Give him some love

I've asked my Twitter followers to show him some love and support and I hope they are doing. I would like to ask my readers to do the same. Please head on over to [his channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCspJ-h5Mw9_zeEhJDzMpkkA) and show him some love.
