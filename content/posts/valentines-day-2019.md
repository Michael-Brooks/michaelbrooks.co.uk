description: "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions."

Today is Valentine's Day which means couples will be spending time together. Maybe they'll spoil each, or maybe they'll chill with some Netflix. However they spend Valentine's, it can be a wonderful day.

For others however, today can just add to their depression or anxiety because they feel they're alone or not with anyone.

We should send our love to those who may feel left out. No one should feel vulnerable or alone because of some celebration or holiday. Today, I will be spending time with my wife, but I will be sending my love out to those that are suffering today. I ask that my readers do the same. ♥️
