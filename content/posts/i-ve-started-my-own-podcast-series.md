This is a quick blog post to let my readers know, I now have my own podcast series which you can listen and subscribe to on all of the popular platforms. This includes [Anchor, Spotify, Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, PocketCasts and more.](https://anchor.fm/michaelbrooks)

If your favourite platform isn’t shown above, then please go to Anchor to see if it’s on there. If it isn’t, then Anchor is always adding new platforms, so you may need to wait for it to turn up.

You can always contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbrooksuk), and I will try to get it distributed in more places.

I hope you enjoy listening to the episodes, and I look forward to hearing from your feedback. Also, if you listen on Apple, I would love it if you could give it a positive rating.

If you want to know more about what the podcast is about, then it’s about health and fitness. I talk about cooking with Gousto, CrossFit, fitness watches and anything else to do with health and fitness. If this sounds like your thing, then please take a listen. Also, you can leave voice message on Anchor, and I would love to encourage my readers to do so, so I can add them to future episodes.
