After reading [Tim Ferriss' year review](https://tim.blog/2018/12/28/past-year-review/), I decided to do something similar. I couldn't go through my calendar as I never use one for events (maybe I should start next year).

You can see below my results below.

It's shows both positive and negative events for the year. Hopefully I can learn from this for next year.

Positive

- Created WODemocracy
- New car
- Helped Tiff start pet sitting business
- 2 years at work
- Met Dmitry and Valery
- Cut down debt by half
- More consistent at CrossFit and entered three competitions
- Twitter/blogging is more consistent
- Made new connections
- Got my first passport

Negative

- Worry about job loss
- Yogi Bear (cat) passing away
- 3 panic attacks

Overall, I've had more positive events than negative ones, hopefully this carries on for next year.
