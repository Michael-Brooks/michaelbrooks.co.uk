## Purchase some motivational posters

I have opened up an online store with Woocommerce and Printful and will be selling motivational posters. If you would like to take a look, then head over to [this page](/blog/motivation/) and see for yourself. If you would like to give feedback, then please feel free to contact me through comments, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MBrooksUK) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/MBrooksDeveloper/). I will reply back to you and will take all suggestions on board.

I am also looking to see if you have any issues when going through the checkout process, so if you do decide to purchase, let me know how your experience went. I would love to hear from you.

## What's the story behind this?

I'm always struggling with trying to find motivation in doing things, and I love to create. What's better than helping myself and others find motivation and being creative? I can't find a lot of things that are better, so that is why. Whenever I find a motivational quote, I write it down and then find an image that's just as inspiring and fits the topic. I then usually post it on my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/mike_d_brooks/) and if I find it's really inspiring and motivational, then I create a poster of that. I will try t-shirts and other apparel in the future and experiment to find what works and what doesn't.

Hopefully, you guys like what I am trying to do and appreciate the work I've put into this. Please please please comment below if you support this and I would love to start a conversation with you guys.
