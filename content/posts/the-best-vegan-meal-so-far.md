description: "For what seems like forever, I wanted to create my very own social networking site. At first, it was going to compete with Facebook, have reactions (before they invented it), and use open technologies. I started creating something with my custom PHP, I created the ability to register, log in and add friends. It was going great and my friends were playing around with it. A few bugs were being reported which I would try to fix, and a few months later, I got bored."

I've only been a vegan for 4 days, so don't take this as an official best vegan meal. This meal really filled me up and tasted amazing. It takes around an hour (15min prep and 45min cooking), but the wait is well worth it in my opinion.

It's called "[Vegan chickpea curry jacket potatoes](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/vegan-chickpea-curry-jacket-potato)", and contains a kind of curry mix with some extras. The finished dish is superb and if you're a vegan looking for something new, I highly recommend you give this a go.
