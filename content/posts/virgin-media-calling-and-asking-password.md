## Receiving a phone call from Virgin Media

Last week some time, I received a phone call from Virgin Media. The caller said he would like to talk to me regarding my account, which at first seemed fairly legit. I asked him what the problem was and to his response, I was shocked.

The reply was "Firstly Michael, I need to know your password". After telling him that I'm not giving him my password as he rang me. He should know that he is talking to the correct person.

Personally, I felt like this could have easily been some fraudulent call. After him not giving up on this, despite me asking several times what it was actually regarding and him repeating... "I can't tell you, until you give me your password". I said to him that you can send me a letter with what this is regarding and I hung up.

## The problem continues

This wouldn't have been a problem if I was the one who rung them up. But the fact he did this when calling ME, I was not going to tell him. I personally feel that this isn't the best way to handle the call, and he should have asked me other questions like my address, or say the 2nd and 5th characters of my password. If I were to have friends/family around, I wouldn't tell him my password as it could be used on other websites like Facebook and Twitter, so it should be dealt in another way.

The terms even speaks about not asking for your password (shown below). Surely this means they are going against their own terms on this.

If anyone has had the same, or similar experiences on this then please share your thoughts and what you did to deal with the situation.

They did in fact send me a letter, and it was to do with being behind on payments. Why they couldn't even hint at this still baffles me, but I rang them up and had it all sorted.
