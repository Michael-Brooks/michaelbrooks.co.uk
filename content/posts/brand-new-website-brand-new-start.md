## Here I go again, on my quest for a new website...

Of becoming a Web Master. It's been a while since I properly posted on my Blog. And so I wondered the best way to go about this. As I went back to my old site and old Blog. I looked at it and I couldn't help but think that the way of making templates on Blogger was a bit too tedious and slap-dashed and was in need of a new website.

Now I'm using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) at work and starting to feel like it is such a great tool to use. I felt like I should start my new site using a platform which embraces Laravel and so here I am, using [WardrobeCMS](https://wardrobecms.com).

From what I have seen so far, it bolts on some pretty nifty packages and creates something that is simple and elegant. Rather than HTML, it uses a markdown language which looks amazing and it's so simple to use.

In the future, I hope to create my own theme for it and maybe even make some packages to enhance what is already becoming a lovely piece of kit. I also plan on doing a lot of tutorials focusing mainly on Laravel itself. And possibly some packages which I find useful through my journey.
