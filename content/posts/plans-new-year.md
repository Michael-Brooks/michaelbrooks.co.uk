I never do the "New year, New me" bullshit, I have always believed that the end of the year is a time to reflect what we have done over the past few years and what we can improve upon for the new year to come.

## A little look into my past

Let's start with looking back at what happened to me. I have gone through two workplaces, my first workplace was struggling with money and had to let some people go, me being one of them ([Sound familiar?](/dealing-with-performance-anxiety-and-depression-as-a-web-developer)). The other company had to let me go due to me not being able to pick things up quick enough.

All in all, I am now way more positive about this than I have ever been and I'm proud of myself with the fact I can now handle these situations in a much more positive light. Both companies have been fantastic to work with and I wouldn't change my choices for the world.

## A little peak into my future

Now coming into 2017, I will be starting a new position on January the 3rd and it won't be PHP or backend based. I will be a frontend React developer which will be completely new, but also very exciting. The company isn't an agency and offers a great product which I believe will be incredible to work on.

I'm now creating a business plan so I can create my very own online store which will be selling technology and gadgets. I tried to start this before, but I didn't go into it 100% and I made so many mistakes. I believe that now I am older and much wiser, I will go into it with everything I have and actually make an incredible career out of it.

There are many more plans for next year which I will be sharing as it gets closer, so please keep your eyes peeled and subscribe to my Blog's RSS feed. Any comments are also appreciated and I really hope you guys have had an amazing Christmas and have a very happy new year.
