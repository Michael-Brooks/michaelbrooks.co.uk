description: It's been over a week since my colleagues and I completed the Jurassic Hike for Macmillan cancer support. I'm happy to announce that I finished the 26-mile hike and raised a total of £253.44 which is 101% of my target. Together as a team, we all managed to succeed our targets and in total reached 117% of our goal which amounts to £2,045.87.

For everyone who has donated and shared, I just wanted to say a massive thank you. The event starts next week and it's a gruelling 26-mile hike. We are now 75% towards our target, and I need your help to reach 100%. Please donate if you can, if not then please share this article so others can see.

My colleagues and I have done so much training, and gone through so much pain in preparation for the event. Just last weekend, we walked 22 miles, and our bodies hurt the next day. However, all this training and pain is worth it. It's worth it, because those of have battled cancer, or are still battling cancer have gone through so much more.

They battle through the pain, they battle through the heartache, anxiety and so much more! This makes what we are doing worth it.

My mum battled cancer twice and won. She is my hero and everything I do, I do it for her. Of course, not everyone is as lucky and we must remember those who lost the battle to cancer. That's why we're doing this, to help the survival rate and to ensure cancer becomes a non-issue.

Please help us, [donate and share](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/michael-brooks-macmillan) anywhere you can and we will be super grateful for your support. We love you all!
