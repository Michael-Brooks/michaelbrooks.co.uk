I watched a video today by the lovely Anna Reel where she says "In spite of fear, do it anyway". This pretty much goes along with what I've read. A book called [Feel the Fear and do it anyway](https://amzn.to/2X1PRFM) explains it in much better detail. However, the basics of it are, if you fear something, you should do it anyway. Usually the best outcomes in life are because you faced fear head on.

Take skydiving, for instance, no one ever does it and not feel fear. Especially on their first try. However, when you take the leap, it can be a breathtaking experience. This can also be applied for speaking in front of an audience, releasing a song, book or picture to people you don't know. Whatever it is you want to do, do it! Give it all that you've got, and you honestly won't regret it. It's better to regret something you've done, then it is to regret something you haven't.
