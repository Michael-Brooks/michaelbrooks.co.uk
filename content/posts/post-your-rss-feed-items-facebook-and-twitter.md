If you have a Blog in a CMS which isn't Wordpress, Drupal or Joomla, then you will likely not have some automated way to post your new blog posts over to Twitter or Facebook.

I have started using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) to automate a lot of my workflow, but I couldn't find any applets which would automatically post my feed items to Facebook or Twitter. I then went and created my own RSS applets, but hard coded the URL as it was just for my personal use. I then thought to myself "I bet other people may find this useful". So, I decided to create similar applets, but you can set your own RSS feed URL and have it post to your Twitter page, or you can post it to a Facebook business page.

Check out the [link here](https://ifttt.com/p/MichaelDBrooks) and let me know what you guys think.

Of course, it doesn't have to be just your blog items, it could be anyone's blog items. If you would like them posted elsewhere, then please let me know, and I can create the applet for you.
