I had this discussion on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/MBrooksUK) to which I said...

> To anyone that doesn't have a blog. What's holding you back from creating one?

I had a discussion with a lovely lady who said her posts aren't well written enough. She's worried people either won't like them, or they're too boring and blogging can be very stressful etc.

## It's your blog, you can write what you want, when you want.

The great thing about having your own website or your own blog, you can write what you want when you want. The only stress you gain is the stress you put on yourself. No one demands content from you, and even if they did they can go elsewhere. Because this is your turf, your domain, your property. Your audience is being welcomed in, and if they like what they see, they can stay and even converse.

Start a blog by writing about your interests and enjoy the process. Share it with other who you think will enjoy it, it can be friends, family or someone you speak to online. Let them give you feedback and be open to that feedback. Your first round of posts will probably be terrible, but you will get better and you will gain experiences like no other.

## Let me tell you a secret...

My first [ever blog](https://checkeredmichael.blogspot.com/) wasn't good, but it was a good start. If you look at my first round of posts on here, they're probably terrible compared to now. No blog post will ever be perfect, you just have to start and the best time to start is now. You can always build your site as you go, and you can edit your posts if you need to.

As Susan Jeffers has written you should "[feel the fear and do it anyway](https://amzn.to/2Dx8TLd)". Life is too short to be worrying what people might say or think. If you don't do something now, then when are you going to start?
