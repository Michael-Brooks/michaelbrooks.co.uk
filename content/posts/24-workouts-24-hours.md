description: It's been over a week since my colleagues and I completed the Jurassic Hike for Macmillan cancer support. I'm happy to announce that I finished the 26-mile hike and raised a total of £253.44 which is 101% of my target. Together as a team, we all managed to succeed our targets and in total reached 117% of our goal which amounts to £2,045.87.

I am taking part in what seems like a crazy event, but I am super stoked and will be looking forward to taking part and
supporting an awesome charity. It is a Crossfit event held at [CrossFit Cheltenham](https://www.crossfitcheltenham.co.uk)
and it's 24 workouts on the hour, every hour for a complete time of 24 hours. I am aiming to take part in the full 24
hours and will be live streaming it on [Periscope/Twitter](https://www.periscope.tv/mike_d_brooks), you can follow me if
you would like to watch.

If you would like to help support me, then you can [follow this link](/justgiving) to donate (every little helps).
Or if you are looking to go shopping, but can't afford to donate, then you can have a percentage of your online spending
go towards the donations through [GoRaise](https://www.goraise.co.uk/oli-jeacock).

The event will be starting on Sat 1st July at 12pm (GMT) until Sun 2nd July 12pm (GMT). If you would also like to take
part or go to the event and spectate, then you are more than welcome to (the more the merrier), just be sure to bring a
sleeping bag and plenty of food.

If you would like to see the live event, then please follow either my [Periscope](https://www.periscope.tv/Mike_D_Brooks)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mbrooksuk) accounts and give me a follow.
