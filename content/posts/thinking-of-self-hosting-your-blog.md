I've self-hosted my blog for a long time now and I've just migrated my wife's website from [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com) to self-hosted. For general purpose WordPress websites, I've found the best hosting is through [SiteGround](https://www.siteground.co.uk/index.htm?afcode=69eb60ca183b5e801f806be97490c807). They offer great solutions for exactly what you need. E.g. they have optimised hosting for Wordpress, WooCommerce or general cloud hosting. You can go from hosting one site or upgrade to host multiple sites.

Their support is 24/7 and you can contact them using phone, chat or email, and you can choose what works for you. WordPress websites come pre-installed with plugins that speed up your blog and get you started with themes. If you would like to see my wife's website, then you can take a look at [Brooks Pet Sitters](https://brookspetsitters.com) to get a feel.

They offer a no-risk 30-day money back guarantee which means you can't lose.
