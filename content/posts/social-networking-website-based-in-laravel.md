## Laravel social networking website.

I've been wanting to make a social networking website for a long time, one which will rival the big guys. I also thought about maybe doing it following the footsteps of Mark Zuckerberg by recording my steps live on my Blog and get feedback to what others think. That way, I can create something which everyone wants and unleash something which almost everyone will love.

I will also release any tutorial worthy stuff as I go through my development to help anyone else who are thinking of making their own social networking sites using Laravel.

I'm starting out with the basics, such as: registration, messaging, pages etc.

What are your likes and dislikes about Facebook, Google+ and Twitter? Let me know in the comments so I can get some awesome feedback.
