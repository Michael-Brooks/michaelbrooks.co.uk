description: "Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions."

If you're looking forward to what Laravel 5.3 has to offer then I would definitely recommend that you watch this video of Taylor Otwell which goes into detail on what the latest version has to offer. It is pretty long at 1 hour and 36 minutes, but my gosh is it worth it.
