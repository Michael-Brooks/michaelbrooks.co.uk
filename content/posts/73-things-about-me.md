**1. What is your usual Starbucks order?**  
I normally buy Costa, but I would say seasonal drinks are my goto. Especially ginger or cinnamon lattes are amazing.  
  
**2. What does your workstation look like right now?**  
This is what my home desk looks like. I take the red mechanical keyboard to work with me because it's so good.  
  
**3. All time favourite food?**  
It used to be steak and chips, but since going vegan, I've gone for [Mousakka Bowls](https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/vegan/moussaka-bowls/), it's just so tasty. ?  
  
**4. Favourite author?**  
I don't read a lot a lot of fictional books and I've gotten into reading self-help books. Tim Ferriss has been great, as well as Dale Carnegie and Anthony Robbins are a few of my faves.  
  
**5. What do you think of open relationships?**  
I think that they make a lot of sense and that to limit love to one person and/or expect someone to be your ‘everything’ is something that I struggle with. A polyamorous relationship is something that I would be open to, but I do think that it can leave all parties open to confusion and heartbreak if there is a lack of communication and honesty. It has to be something that everyone consents to. I’ve met guys before who have told me that they were poly – it’s just a shame that their wife or girlfriend wasn’t aware  
  
**6. What is your favourite video game?**  
Mario Party, or Tetris…  
  
**7. Guilty pleasure treat?**  
Food wise, Chinese takeaway and until recently, my guilty pleasure has been Pretty Little Liars, but I’ve finished it all now so need to find something else that my husband abhors! Mwahaha  
  
**8. Favourite movie?**  
Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind  
  
**9. Favourite book?**  
A toughie… There is a very old book I have from the 70s called ‘[The Little Girl who Lived Down The Lane’](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1170307.The_Little_Girl_Who_Lives_Down_the_Lane) by Laird Koenig. I read it when I was a teenager and although it’s set in America, it reminds me of a place I know very well in Cornwall. Its very dark and there was a movie made with Jodie Foster – but it’s nowhere near as good as the book.  
  
Also, [‘The Visible World’](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/462142.The_Visible_World) by Mark Slouka completely broke me when I read it. Its very, very beautiful. The type of writing that one dreams about being able to create.  
  
**10. Twitter or Instagram?**  
Um… neither? Each platform does have its bonuses but I sometimes find social media in general to be just all too overwhelming. I do interact with people more on Twitter, which can be lovely but sometimes I just need a few days away from it all.  
  
**11. Desktop or laptop?**  
I don’t think I really have a preference. Either is better that trying to type up a post or answers to 73 questions on a mobile phone  
  
**12. Best advice you’ve ever received?**  
Speak the truth even when your voice shakes. Be proud of who you are and what you believe in.  
  
1**3. What project are you working on right now?**  
Project ‘get Naomi a new job’  
  
**14. Favourite colour?**  
Green  
  
**15. Did you get good grades at school?**  
Absolutely not. School was really hard, for a few reasons, but my last 18 months were severely affected and I only took English and Maths at GSCE. I have proven to myself as an adult that it wasn’t through lack of intelligence though – but it’s still frustrating sometimes.  
  
**16. Dream job?**  
I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately. Something where I can help people, whilst also being creative and able to write… I don’t know what that job is. I do have a dream of what I would like to ultimately do, but that would take a lottery win to get off the ground  
  
**17. Played any sports?**  
_shudders_  
  
Unless Yoga and Davina DVDs count?  
  
**18. Do you have a degree?**  
I will do at some point! I’ve completed my first year with the OU but have taken a little break recently because of health reasons and the amount of time that I could(nt) commit to it.  
  
1**9. Nationality?**  
British. (Not African as some random in my DM’s was convinced of the other day…)  
**  
20. What is your favourite kind of blog post to do?**  
They are the hardest, but definitely the more personal ones.  
  
**21. What do you like to collect?**  
_Glances over at groaning bookshelves_ Do all of those books count?  
  
**22. Describe yourself in three words**  
Indecisive, empathic, introverted  
**  
23. If you were a rapper what would your rapper name be?**  
I think this is the hardest question yet…  
  
**24. Who was the last person you DMed?**  
On Twitter, the guy who blocked me after thinking I was African. Instagram, my best friend April and WhatsApp, my husband.  
  
**25. What’s on the top of your wish list right now?**  
That hayfever season will end soon (from July mine gets better, I think it’s grass pollen related) that I get the job I really do want rand it’s as good as I hope it will be  
  
**26. Hogwarts house?**  
Apparently I’m a Hufflepuff? Although I have never read Harry Potter and I’ve only watched the first two films with a running commentary from my best friends son…

**27. How many tattoos do you have?**  
None. I’ve been thinking of getting some temporary ones from inkbox though and seeing how I feel with them.  
  
**28. What are you most grateful for this year?**  
My husband, my friends, my dog and my home. They all mean the absolute world to me  
  
**29. What’s the best thing that’s happened to you this month?**  
Finding the courage to quit my job. I should have done it months ago…  
  
**30. What’s the best thing that’s happened to you today?**  
Having some time after a crazy and very stressful week to have some time to myself.  
**  
31. What’s the best thing ever?**  
The smell of my dogs fur when he comes in for a snuggle. Chilling out with my husband and sweet and salty popcorn – still hot. Getting to the top of a mountain and admiring the view, the bridge that takes you from England to Wales. My mums roast dinner…  
  
**32. Favourite season?**  
Autumn  
  
**33. Favourite holiday?**  
I’m with Naomi @[InchingForwards](https://inchingforwards.com/) on this one – the build up to Christmas is just magical.  
  
**34. Which fictional character do you relate to most?**  
I think Clementine from Eternal Sunshine… although my hair is too dark to dye all of those wonderful colours! Or perhaps April Ludgate…  
  
**35. Do you like surprises?**  
Not really. I tend to worry that my reaction will never be enough to show gratitude to the planning and consideration that someone has gone through…  
**  
36. What’s the biggest surprise you’ve ever had?**  
My husband took me to Poland for my birthday a few years ago. I had no idea where we were going until we got to the check in desk – it was a truly wonderful surprise and was like going to a snow filled winter wonderland  
  
**37. What’s a surprise that made you cry?**  
Finding out that my sister in law was pregnant and my little brother was going to be a Dad to the most amazing little boy  
  
**38. What’s the best surprise you’ve ever given anyone?**  
I’m not one for springing huge surprises on people but I bought my husband an Angry Shiba soft cushion for his birthday this week, which he was definitely not expecting but that he loved ?  
  
**39. Do you like muffins?**  
Cake-y muffins are a bit much in one go for me. But savoury muffins are nice with a poached egg on top!  
  
**40. Do you cook often?**  
Pretty much everyday – unless we are very tired and then we just eat pizza ?.  
  
**41. What’s your favourite dessert?**  
I haven’t got a huge sweet tooth – so either something sharp and citrusy, or a cheeseboard. Although saying that, if a treacle tart is on the menu I’d go for that!  
  
**42. Is there a dessert you don’t like?**  
Double chocolate cake… anything really rich and sweet  
  
**43. Cake or pie?**  
Pie – sweet is ok, but savoury if I had the choice.

**44. What’s your least favourite food?**  
Anything really meaty – I’m not a vegetarian but I’m not the biggest fan of a lot of meat. Thick burgers, chicken packed stuff, any sort of offal-y type things, liver – yuk!

**45. What’s your favourite condiment?**  
Salt. I’m a terror for it…

**46. It’s 4am on a Saturday night, what would you eat?**  
Crisps… Or cheese.

**47. If you could teach a college class what would it be called?**  
Hmm… it would be something about self-acceptance and kindness / inclusivity towards ourselves and others.

**48. Best animated film?**  
Beauty and The Beast (the original, not the Emma Watson one)

**49. What has a guy done or said to impress you?**

Been honest with me and consistently being there through the hard times as well as the great times.

**50. Best thing to do on a first date?**

Something chilled and informal – a nice walk followed by a bite to eat perhaps.

**51. Worst thing to do on a first date?**

Be rude to the waiting staff. It’s a common answer I’m sure, but observing how someone treats others gives you a good idea of their personality in general.

**52. What’s the funniest pick up line a guy could use on a girl?**

Aren’t pick up lines all a it cheesy?

**53. Best comic book character?**

Does Morrigan count as a comic book character?

**54. What are three things that are always in your purse?**

My keys, tissues, a book

**55. Favourite drink?**

I like just plain water, or Australian red wine…

**56. If you could play a historical character who would it be?**

Vita Sackville-West

**57. Kittens or puppies?**

Puppies – I like cats, but I’m a dog fan through and through…

**58. Favourite sushi roll?**

I should eat more sushi, and pay attention to the names of the ones I really like.

**59. What kind of lipstick do you use?**

I don’t really, usually just lip balm. But if I do then I tend to go a bit dark and gothic…

**60. What kind of foundation do you use?**

Its one from The Body Shop

**61. Blow dry or air dry?**

I usually blow dry – only because my hair is quite thick and heavy, so it needs a bit of uplift from the roots or it weighs itself down. I am liking it curly, or naturally wavy whilst I’m off work though.

**62. Who is your fashion icon?**

Its always been Andrea Corr ❤

**63. Favourite Disney character?**

Belle

**64. What are you doing tomorrow?**

Making the most of our last official holiday day…

**65. Movie you laughed the hardest through?**

I find Will Ferrell pretty funny if I see him in things… but I don’t tend to watch a lot of comedy.

**66. Movie that made you cry?**

Oh crikey… Beaches, Titanic, The Great Beyond, Never Let Me Go, Allied, Up, Hatchi: A Dogs Tale…. I usually cry at a lot

**67. If you could sing a duet with someone who would it be?**

Probably my best friend April ❤

**68. If your life was a song what would the title be?**

Kinda depends on the day… Right now Motion Sickness by Pheobe Bridgers seems very relatable.

**69. What’s your favourite animal?**

Dogs ❤ Or otters, bears and bees

**70. Favourite illustrator?**

[Christian Schloe](https://society6.com/christianschloe) is really good, but I don’t think I have a favourite…

**71. Person you want to have coffee with?**

Naomi @[inchingforwards](https://twitter.com/InchingForwards) would be a pretty interesting coffee date I think ?

**72. What’s a country you wish to visit?**

Soooo many. But right now, I’m very much liking the idea of visiting Canada

**73. Best way to decompress?**

Yin Yoga, followed by a hot bath and a good book.
