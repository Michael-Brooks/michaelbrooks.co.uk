  write your first ebook. I've been thinking about how I would love to create an ebook,
  but I didn't know what to write about. Researching how to create an ebook leads

You heard right, the first ebook I will be creating will about how to write your first ebook. I've been thinking about how I would love to create an ebook, but I didn't know what to write about. Researching how to create an ebook leads to people explaining you should use Canva, Google Docs or something completely different, but they don't explain how or why.

Canva is an incredible design tool, but why would I use it for information? How would I add a table of contents to my Canva ebook? Google Docs is obviously an amazing document tool. However, the same questions can be asked here. You have to piece together each question to find the correct answers in order to get a definitive answer.

I thought I would save everyone the hassle of this and use the knowledge I gain to help others in creating their ebook(s). The ebook will cover getting started, from planning to the creation and then selling and marketing. Each chapter will be a complete step by step guide. By the end, you will have created your very own ebook to market and sell.
