I had to be made redundant by my previous employee due to lack of funds and not being able to push enough work my way. Luckily, the guys there are pretty cool and was happy to be my reference for any future employment. I was really lucky to find a new workplace and as soon as I left, I started my new position with Pulse8 Broadband."

Lots have been going on recently, so I do apologise for not writing a post as of late. I had to be made redundant by my previous employee due to lack of funds and not being able to push enough work my way. Luckily, the guys there are pretty cool and was happy to be my reference for any future employment. I was really lucky to find a new workplace and as soon as I left, I started my new position with [Pulse8 Broadband](https://pulse8broadband.co.uk).

Now I am working on a single website and trying to push it up to be an amazing website to visit. I am looking migrate the website over to Laravel in the near future as this will make development easier and faster to push out updates.

I'm looking forward to the future and any Laravel tutorials I post from now on will be with version 5 as I've already pushed myself over and have loved it since it's official release.

Hope to speak to my followers again soon and as always, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.
