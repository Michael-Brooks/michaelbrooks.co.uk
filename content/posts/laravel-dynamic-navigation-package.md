I have managed to create a dynamic navigation package for Laravel which can be seen in my previous post. If you go to [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/checkeredmichael/navigation) you will be able to find my package under checkeredmichael/navigation.

I have created a readme with this package which should get you started on implementing it within your own projects. I would like to get as many people as possible to use this package and come back with feedback/bug fixes.

This is my very first public package and I will be using it to expand on other packages such as my very own admin package for Laravel which will be created in the future.

If anyone requires further assistance then please let me know in the comments of this post or contact me.
