I must admit, it took my wife and I a while to get into Game of Thrones. So many people were hyping it up and saying "YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!" that it didn't quite appeal to us. However, once the dust had settled, we finally decided to take a look. Wow, we couldn't believe it took us so long to actually get into it, the whole series has just been amazing.

Now we're onto the final season and I am both excited, yet sad as it means we won't get more action in the future. I guess all things have to come to an end, and I'm interested to see how good the spin-offs will be. Hopefully, this finally will tie up all the loose ends though, because we can't have it end on a cliff-hanger.

One thing my friend mentioned is the dragon. It's a mythical beast that breathes fire, so when it resurrects, why does it breathe ice? When the white walkers resurrect humans, they become wights which have no power. If this is the case, then sure the dragon should resurrect with no ice/flame capability and be a flying lizard that eats people?

I checked the [fandom page](https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/White_Walkers). It doesn't explain anything, and I'm sure if the books got this far, then it would explain it. I guess we'll have to wait and see and I am hopeful.

What are your thoughts on the latest Game of Thrones trailer? Let me know and you can watch it below if you haven't already.
