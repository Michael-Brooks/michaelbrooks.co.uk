On the 15th of June, I will be taking part in a 23-mile hike for Macmillan Cancer with a few colleagues from work, and I am super excited to be taking part in this. We will all be training together, but I'm not too worried. I've been doing CrossFit for over 3 years and feel I have it in the bag. 💪

Last year I raised [£175 for Macmillan](/i-have-donated-175-to-macmillan-cancer-research/) and I am so grateful for the donations. However, this year I want to more than double the donation, and I can only do this with your help. If you can, please donate to my [JustGiving page](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/michael-brooks-macmillan), and I will be super grateful. Alternatively, you can share the page on social media and I will be forever thankful. 🙏
