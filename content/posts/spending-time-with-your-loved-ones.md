After two weeks of not really seeing each other, I'm thankful that I can spend some time with my wife. She's been very busy pet sitting, and I've been helping her where I can. Due to this, we have had some time away. Although it's nice to spend some time apart, it's also nice to spend quality time together.

This is also the same for my friends and family. Due to moving away and work commitments, it can be hard to find the time. However, we should be using our free time to share it with others, because we don't know what could happen in the future. This enables us to let go of our worries and share our happiness with those closest.
