Some days I wake up at 4:30, others at 5 on weekdays then on Saturday I get up at 7 in the morning. How do I do this you ask?

It started off when I read the book called "[The Chimp Paradox](https://amzn.to/2CibRmo)", and it would tell me ways to silence my chimp. The chimp is the voice in the back of your head, screaming when it doesn't want you to do something. Your chimp wants rewards and none of the work. You need to understand your chimp and learn how to reward it with work.

When I get up in the morning, I will literally jump out of bed. This will shock my body and my chimp, and it won't know what to do before it's happened. Some days, I'll want to stay in bed, but I know my reward is a satisfied body once I've worked out. Crossfit is something I enjoy and that is my reward for the morning. The social aspect, working out and everything in between is all something that makes me happy.

If you do something in the morning that's a self-reward, then you are more likely to wake up. That reward could be a tea or coffee. It could be working out, reading a book or even writing. If you do this reward before heading out to work, then you'll probably feel a lot more happier throughout your day to day life.

Ask yourself "What is my reward?" and wake up to that every day. You can even comment your reward down below as a way to hold yourself accountable.
