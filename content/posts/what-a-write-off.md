Today has been pretty stressful to say the least. Having some guy shout at me through his car window really got to be. It shouldn't have and most things usually go over my head, but this got me. It was probably the fact that my day already wasn't going well and this was the nail in the coffin which sent me over the edge.

Then to top it all off, my washing machine is causing my fuse box to switch off. This probably means it needs replacing. Which sucks for two reasons. Firstly, I can no longer wash any more clothes and secondly, I have to find a new one.

Tomorrow is another day and I'll be using it to find a replacement washer. I hope my readers have had a better day, and I hope you also have a lovely weekend. We just need to stay strong and keep smiling because better days will come.
