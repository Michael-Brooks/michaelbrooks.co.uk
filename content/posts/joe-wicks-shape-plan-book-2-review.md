Joe Wicks has become a loveable character with his charm and witty banter. When I first saw him on Channel 4 ([Joe Wicks: The Body Coach](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/joe-wicks-the-body-coach/on-demand/63661-002)), I couldn't help but think how annoying he was, but wow did his food look amazing...

So because of the delicious food on the telly, I became so engrossed that by the end of it, I couldn't help but love him and what he stood for. His mentality in that dieting was wrong and you should eat whole, healthy foods really rung true in my ears.

The next day, I purchased this book on Amazon Prime and awaited it's delivery. I then started cooking all sorts of meals.

This book contains a lot more carbohydrate meals and recommends you to eat 2 low carb meals and one carb meal on a rest day and 2 high carb meals on a workout day.

For some this may the seem overkill for their carb intake and I would agree. I personally feel that if you are getting bloated due to all the carbs, then you should cut down where you can, at least until your body is used to it.

I can whole heartedly say that I have yet to eat a bad meal from this book and I always look forward to what is next within the day. There are some meals like the chunky monkey smoothie and the fats-me-up smoothie which I could eat every morning, and not get bored of them at all.

Now, for the negatives (not many, but definitely important)... The biggest negative, and just like the first book, you really do need to prep like a boss. I know it says it right at the start of the book, but do NOT take this lightly. My partner and I missed a weekly plan at the beginning of our start week and it completely through us off for that entire week. Joe Wicks can not stress enough just how important this is.

Finally, the shopping can get costly, especially at first. It should start balancing out, but just be prepared to splash out a little from the start. If you keep these two negatives in mind then you are definitely good to go and will enjoy every recipe from his book.
