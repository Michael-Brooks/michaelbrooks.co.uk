I’m not the biggest Apple fan; in fact, I always avoided Apple products and stuck with either Microsoft or Android. I even had Windows phones because I thought they were going to take over the market and become a competitor to Android and Apple.

It wasn’t until the release of the iPhone 11 when I finally decided to give Apple a chance. I purchased it as an upgrade to my Pixel 2 as the Pixel 4 wasn’t a real upgrade, and the 4K video on both the front and back lenses attracted me to take my chances. It worked out, and recently I decided I wanted to give the iPad Pro a go as well.

I took a look at comparisons between the 11” and the 12.9”. The differences between them weren’t just the screen sizes, but there were also a few hardware differences too, and the 12.9” just had a little more going for it in my eyes.

## The things I love about the iPad Pro

1. Portability

The portability of the iPad Pro is incredible. It’s much more lightweight than most laptops out there, even when you pair it with the magic keyboard. The size is also perfect for me, it’s not too big and not too small, and I love the fact I can take it with me anywhere and start writing. I’m writing this blog post in my wife’s car while I wait for her to finish her pet sitting.

If I had a laptop, I would have to open it up, turn it on. Then wait for it to boot before I could log in and open a program to do some writing. Now I can unfold my iPad, swipe up and open my favourite editor. The difference in effort is nothing short of incredible.

I also love going from my desktop pc, which has become my main-working station to my couch and opening up my iPad.

2. Apple Pencil

I purchased the Apple Pencil because I wanted to try my hand at some ProCreate. I’ve had a Surface Pro 3 in the past, which was a great machine until it started slowing down. On my Pro 3, I loved the Adobe experience, which you can also get on the iPad. However, most people prefer to use ProCreate as the digital design app of choice for iPads.

Now, I’m not an artist by any means, but I have always enjoyed being able to draw from time to time, and having this as an extra has been excellent. It’s helped me do more of my hobbies and unwind from social media. I haven’t used the pencil for notes or designing apps or anything like that, but at least it gives me that option if I ever need it.

Also, pairing the iPad with a screen protector such as the Paperlike or Bellemond protector adds a paper-like texture and can improve your drawing experience. I don’t usually use a screen protector on any of my mobile or tablet devices, but after hearing how it can add a more paper feel and reduces glare which was a massive sell for me.

3. The Apple Ecosystem

The Apple ecosystem has always been something that I disliked with Apple products. I didn’t want to get suckered into their ecosystem and be hindered by their walled garden. It is both a blessing and a curse in all honesty. However, the magic keyboard and Apple Pencil pairing and working together makes for a lovely experience. Also, I loved the fact I could place my iPhone nearby, and have it recognise my Apple profile and transfer any selected data.

I have honestly never seen such a more superior experience when I’ve used both Microsoft and Android products. However, I am still trying not to buy everything Apple-based. I still have Sony headphones and a Garmin fitness watch which work perfectly fine connected to my Apple devices.

4. Multitask like a pro

Okay. You might not be able to multitask like a real laptop or PC, but you can still multitask very well. Right now, I have Google Docs open with YouTube open to the right. You can have it as a floating window which you can move around, or you can have it attached to your current app where you can resize the apps using the black bar towards the centre of the screen. You can see both options below. There’s also another option to have two apps attached and a third app floating around if you feel like a multitasking king.

It’s not a full-blown computing experience, but it works well, and it’s something I enjoy using. Hopefully, Apple can improve on this in the future, and we can have many more apps open at the same time, especially if you feel you haven’t got enough apps open at the same time.

5. Apple Magic keyboard

The Apple Magic keyboard is nice to type on, with very little key-travel, and a comfortable typing experience, you can’t go wrong. I usually favour a full-blown keyboard experience and personally use a Corsair mechanical keyboard for my desktop and typically take it with me to work because I prefer it to a laptop keyboard. However, the magic keyboard is excellent, and I enjoy using it. I’m using the keyboard to write this whole article that you’re reading right now, which can’t be that bad.

## Conclusion

Overall, and after being someone who actively avoided Apple products, I’m very impressed. The experience has been fantastic, and I can’t wait to see the iPad Pro evolve in the future. Of course, it’s not a full-blown PC like they try to advertise, but it is a productive gadget that you should consider purchasing if you’re looking for a portable and productive device.

It has helped me create more, and be more productive, and I’m hopeful this trend will continue in the future. If you were in two minds about purchasing an iPad Pro, I would say that if it’s ticking all the boxes, then you should take the plunge and you won’t regret the purchase.

Have you purchased an iPad Pro? What are your thoughts? Let us know; I’d love to learn how you have become more productive.
