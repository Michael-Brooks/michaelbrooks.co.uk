This morning I decided to take a look at my Fitbit stats, and I thought... "I wonder what my yearly stats are like". Taking a look, and I am really surprised by these stats. You can see what they are below, and as you can see, I have accomplished a lot.

That is probably my most active year, however, I will be looking to make this year even bigger. More calories burned, more steps, more floors and just all around more of living life. Now I have stats, I will be doing this again next year and compare the differences, along with goals, what went well, what didn't etc.
