As you can see, it has been a while since my last post, but I have been busy trying to push updates over to my website to help strengthen the relationships between you and I.

You can now share any articles you like by scrolling to the bottom of each article and click on the "Share This" button. Each social website which you can share with will pop up. I do however need to improve on this so it will automate text titles, images (when I start adding them) and using selected paragraphs.

I would like to encourage all of my readers to share any posts which you find useful so that it can help other as well. I have also added a [Recommended Reading](/reading) page which you can use to find new and interesting books which have caught my eye. In the future, as I being to read each of those books (which I will), I will post reviews on what I believe has and hasn't helped me and hopefully help you decide on what books will be helpful for you.

If there is anything you would like me to investigate further and create posts on certain situations with a resolution, then please write a comment below detailing what you need help with and I will do my best to investigate and create solutions to these problems.
