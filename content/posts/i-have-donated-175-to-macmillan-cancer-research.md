A few weeks ago, I took part in a Crossfit event called Battle Cancer. This event was in aid of Macmillan Cancer Research, and it was a spectacular event.

I created a campaign due to Battle Cancer not having one which reached £175 and has now donated to Macmillan. I want to thank my friends and family for supporting me, and I hope to do this again in the future.

Hopefully next year, we can get more donations and more people helping out. If anyone would like me as part of their team for next year, please feel free to ask. ?

Battle Cancer will have many more events in even more areas such as... Berlin, Las Vegas, Manchester, London and Madrid. My dream is to attend all of them, but this is dependent on money.
