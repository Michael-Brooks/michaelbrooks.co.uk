I feel like I've made so many connections this year and for that alone makes me truly grateful for 2018. 

- The king of makers called [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio). He has created so many sites/projects and has encouraged me to make my own projects such as [WODemocracy](https://wodemocracy.com/).
- [Daniel](https://twitter.com/iiCe89) is another maker who I enjoy watching. His UI skills are amazing and I love the projects he works on.
- I've been reading [Eric L. Barnes](https://ericlbarnes.com)' blog for a while and always enjoyed his posts on his personal blog and Laravel News, as well as his Twitter page. He' a lovely guy and has always got something positive to say.
- As some of you may know, I suffer from mental health. This means I follow quite a few people from the mental health community. These include, but are not limited to lovely people such as... [James Conlon](https://twitter.com/JamesConlon_), [Hattie Gladwell](https://twitter.com/hatttiegladwell) and [Pinkster C](https://twitter.com/PinksterC_87).
