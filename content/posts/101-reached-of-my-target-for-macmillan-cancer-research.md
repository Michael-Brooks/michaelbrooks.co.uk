description: It's been over a week since my colleagues and I completed the Jurassic Hike for Macmillan cancer support. I'm happy to announce that I finished the 26-mile hike and raised a total of £253.44 which is 101% of my target. Together as a team, we all managed to succeed our targets and in total reached 117% of our goal which amounts to £2,045.87.

It's been over a week since my colleagues and I completed the Jurassic Hike for Macmillan cancer support. I'm happy to announce that I finished the 26-mile hike and raised a total of £253.44 which is 101% of my target. Together as a team, we all managed to succeed our targets and in total reached 117% of our goal which amounts to £2,045.87.

This is amazing and I'm well and truly shocked and surprised with the amount of donations and support we received for doing this. The whole hike was amazing and I actually made an Instagram post which describes exactly how I felt. Instead of rewriting it, I will share the image below and you can read more.

Thank you so much to everyone who donated, shared and supported our efforts towards such an amazing cause. You are all awesome and I love you all.
