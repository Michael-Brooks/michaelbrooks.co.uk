This one may seem like a bit of a downer. Positivity can't be kept 100% of the time, and today is like this for me. I felt a bit down and I can't figure out why. It could be because I had to go to work during a snow day. It could also be the fact that there wasn't much snow here. I absolutely love the snow, and I love playing in it. Call me a big kid, ask me if I'm going to grow up. The truth is, it's a magical time that I don't experience enough.

I would probably grow sick and tired of it if I lived in a cold place, but it rarely happens here. I wanted enough that I could cherish the moment, and it didn't happen today.

I'm now spending some time gaming, this will take my mind of things and hopefully allow me to be positive tomorrow. Gaming gets a lot of bad rep, but it isn't as bad as people make out. In fact, it can be a very positive experience for a lot of people, especially those that suffer depression/anxiety.
