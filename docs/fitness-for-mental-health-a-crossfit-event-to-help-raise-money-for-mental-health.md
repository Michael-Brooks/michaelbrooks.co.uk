We will be performing a Crossfit workout named Becky on the 12th of October. Anyone can participate and all donations will be greatly appreciated. If you do perform the workout, a video of your performance will also be greatly appreciated too, in order to help spread and raise awareness for mental health.

I'm doing this because my wife and I have both suffered from severe mental health. I've had major anxieties due to work, to a point where I would throw up constantly if I took a day off work. My wife has had severe depression because of struggles within her life. We also know so many people who either suffer or have had suffered from mental health in one way or another.

I want to give something back to everyone who suffers through life and doesn't want to wake up in the morning for work or to see friends. This is why I'm fundraising and all donations received will be going to Mind Charity because they do some amazing work for those that suffer from mental health.

The workout is as follows...

* 800 meter Run
* 30 Squat Snatches (95/65 lb)

* 30 Hang Cleans (95/65 lb)

A little background behind the Crossfit workout called Becky...
                    

“Becky” Rebecca Sefscik, a coach at Crossfit The Tracks (Erlanger, KY) and US military veteran, created this workout herself in 2012. Becky Sefscik took her own life on August 31, 2015, after a battle with PTSD.

Her box's website posted that the workout "was tough, just like Becky...She was one of our favourite trainers, best friends and she's missed every day. She was not only an amazing coach, but she was one of the strongest people we all knew, mentally and physically."

In 2015, starting with a CrossFit The Tracks fundraising event on September 7, over 100 gyms and thousands of CrossFitters worldwide did this WOD in a celebration of Becky's life and supporting 22 Until Valhalla for veterans and families affected by suicide and PTSD.
