I have now created an events page. You will be able to keep up to date with all of my events, and talks. My plan is to do at least 3 fundraising events this year, and with social media hiding lots of content, I thought it would be easier to add it here. You can head on over to [Events](/blog/events), as well as look at the sidebar. Some events will be TBC until more details are confirmed, and others will be there straight away.

If you would like to join me in any of these events, then you can comment on the event, DM me on Twitter or message me on Facebook. I will try to get back to you as soon as I am free, but please be patient.

If you have any events you would like to share, then please comment below. I can even add them if others can take part as well.

Finally, I have also updated my [status](/blog/status/) page. Consider it a little bit of social networking, but more static and less hidden.
