These are my top 5 plugins which I think most people should have, especially if you're a blogger looking to make connections and/or your site as fast as possible.

## 5\. Smush

Smush is a fantastic plugin which can help speed up your website by compressing images. You can bulk 'Smush' as they say which will compress images with a single click. If you're on the free version, you can Smush up to 50 images at a time. However, if you pay to upgrade, then you can Smush as many images you like. Both versions will allow you to auto-Smush any future uploaded images.

People say you should install this asap to avoid tons of images needing to be compressed. This way, all images are compressed the minute you decide to upload them.

## 4\. AMP (Accelerated Mobile Project)

[AMP](https://www.ampproject.org) is so good, WordPress themselves decided to help maintain and support it. Google asks that any news site uses AMP, this way your site won't load any unneeded CSS and/or JavaScript when showing in Google search. Google may also give you a slightly higher ranking because AMP shows your site is faster than those that aren't using it.

## 3\. Super Progressive Web Apps

Progressive Web Apps (or PWA for short) allows users to install your blog onto their desktop/tablet/mobile devices. This gives them easier access to your website and it's much better than bookmarks which are never to be seen again. Users will even be able to see your blog offline due to caching, just like a native app on your phone. And best of all, you don't need to submit your blog to any app store, it works straight from any browser which supports PWA. - Download plugin

## 2\. Yoast SEO

Yoast SEO is another great package, even if you don't use it for the SEO part. Then the readability section is great for general blogging. I love getting a little green smile telling me posts are readable. The SEO section is also a very good indicator if you have keywords you would like to hit.

## 1\. JetPack by WordPress.com

Finally, JetPack by WordPress.com is my most important plugin for bloggers. Especially if you're looking to connect with a much wider audience. Think how Medium connects all their readers to a Medium Blog. Now think about hosting that one your own site while still having that audience, and then you have the JetPack plugin.

There are of course many other benefits, such as lazy loading images for faster pages. Automatically share your posts across all your different social networks. If you wanted to, you could also pay extra to enable backups, advanced built-in search and malware protection.

The easiest way to install any of these plugins is through your site's admin panel. You can copy and paste any of the above plugins to find what you need.
