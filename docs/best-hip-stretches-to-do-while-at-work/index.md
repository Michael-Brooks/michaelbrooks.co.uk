Yesterday, my hips were very tight because of some heavy squats I did on Monday. My hips were very immobile, and today I'll talk you through some hip stretches you can do at work.

## 1\. Standing leg cradle - hip stretch at work

I chose this one first because it's my favourite, and I have a standing desk at work. I will do this pose on my stool and get my body as low to the ground as possible. Yesterday, I could barely get my foot up onto the stool, but after using this stretch for a day, I'm now able to. If your hips aren't very flexible, then you may feel some pain or discomfort. If this happens then lift the back of your foot and ease yourself into it. After a while of doing this stretch, it will ease and become a lot easier.

## 2\. The pigeon pose

If you don't have a stool, or you feel really uncomfortable, you can try this hip stretch while at work. You place your front leg at a 90 degree, and your back leg comes out from behind. You can either push your body as low down to the ground as possible, or you can go as far back as your body allows. Try forcing your back leg further back to really get into that hip stretch.

## 3\. Hip Mobility Squat

This is a good one, and it's super simple to do. You need to get down into a squat position and place your arms inside your legs. You can place your hands on the floor for balance, and you can then push your arms out forcing your legs to go as far out as possible. Try to find some discomfort and also try to sway your hips from side to side, and in a circle. You should feel a really nice stretch on both sides of your hips.

These are just three of the best hip stretches to do while at work, if you liked these and would like more in the future, then please let me know. Have these stretches helped your hips at all? What other hip stretches would you recommend while at work?
