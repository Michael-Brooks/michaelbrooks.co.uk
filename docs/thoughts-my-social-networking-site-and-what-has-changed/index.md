## Carrying on with my social networking website

I've had a lot to think about when it comes to the where I want to take my website. Firstly, do I really want to take on such a big task of trying to beat Facebook on my own, when they have a huge team? The answer to that is no, no I don't. I have always had some great ideas with what I wanted to do, but the fact is, I couldn't carry this out on my own.

What could I do instead? I figured I should go for something which possibly hasn't been done before, but it could be similar to something which has already been done, that way I can keep my ideas on the straight and narrow. There have been so many instances where I would come up with these ideas and they would just explode, I would get so excited about these new prospects. However, because most of my thoughts have rarely been carried out before, I would get frustrated because I couldn't find the help I needed.

## Expanding the social idea

What if I created a website which could help like minded people with projects too big for them to carry out themselves? It then came to me, like a brick smacking into my face. I would create a website where users could explain a project they want to create, and then find people close by with similar ideas. They could then meet up somewhere and express these ideas, then they could create the project into something real.

My website will be about users coming in to make a project. You then find people who are interested and meet up with them to make this project a reality. As it's initially a project, my website won't be asking you about wages, or some sort of payment, it will be up to you to make that part a reality.

I would like to apologise for the lack of posts lately as things have been a bit hectic for me and my family, so please bare with me. I can assure you, that I will still be posting and I most definitely making my website a reality for people to enjoy.
