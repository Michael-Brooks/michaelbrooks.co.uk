I know this isn't a massive achievement, but I have a goal to get to 50 unbroken DUs by the end of the year. The other week, I managed to get 14 unbroken which is the most I have done so far. I'll keep you updated with my progress, but for now you can check the video below and follow me for more Crossfit updates.
