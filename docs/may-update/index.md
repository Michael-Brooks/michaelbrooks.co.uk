I just want to write to my Blog followers and notify you all that I have been relatively busy lately and that is the reason for lack of any posts. I have just been employed by a company called [CreateANet](https://createanet.co.uk). They specialise in app development, so it's an exciting time for me and my future. I have been settling in got the past couple of weeks and all seems to be going well thus far.

I am also taking a week off work this week to look after my mum, and as it's giving me some free time, which may give me some free time to create a few tutorial posts and I should be able to continue with the OAuth stuff which I have been promising on for my readers.

Any requests, please post in the comments below and I look forward to speaking with you guys soon.
