I recently had this given to me as a Christmas present and I think it's time to give it a review. This controller is a beast and I doubt I have yet to use this controller to it's full potential. It has so many knobs and triggers that you feel a bit lost when using it for the first time.

However, after a few rounds and a bit of customisation, you really begin to love it and find that it can work to your advantage really well. I have played a lot of Gears of War 4 using this controller and feel like my aiming has improved quite a bit (I won't say dramatically as it's been a short amount of time). My deaths however, probably hasn't improved much, but I'm sure this will change as time goes on.

If you are looking for a professional grade gaming controller, then I highly recommend this one. I doubt any other company can come close to the sheer comfort and quality of this device and you will be glad you spent your money well, when you can see a clear improvement on your gaming.
