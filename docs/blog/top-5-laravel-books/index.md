## Build APIs You Won't Hate: Everyone and their dog wants an API, so you should probably learn how to build them [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0692232699/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=michaelbrooks-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0692232699&linkId=5745e88f60a849c168a8ea58e366968c) | [Amazon.co.uk](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0692232699/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=wedeuk05-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0692232699&linkId=ece8747b1356cf66ba8617117b7bfa82)

Phil Sturgeon (Author), Laura Bohill (Designer)

API development is becoming increasingly common for server-side developers thanks to the rise of front-end JavaScript frameworks, iPhone applications, and API-centric architectures. It might seem like grabbing stuff from a data source and shoving it out as JSON would be easy, but surviving changes in business logic, database schema updates, new features, or deprecated endpoints can be a nightmare.

After finding many of the existing resources for API development to be lacking, Phil learned a lot of things the hard way through years of trial and error. This book aims to condense that experience, taking examples and explanations further than the trivial apples and pears nonsense tutorials often provide.

By passing on some best practices and general good advice you can hit the ground running with API development, combined with some horror stories and how they were overcome/avoided/averted. This book will discuss the theory of designing and building APIs in any language or framework, with this theory applied in PHP-based examples.

Francesco Malatesta

Learning Laravel's Eloquent starts off by taking you through setting up your first project and guiding you in creating a perfect Laravel environment. You will learn how to build the right database structure with the Migrations system and the Schema Builder class. Next, you will be introduced to the main element of Eloquent: the model. After treating the model as a single, isolated entity, you will learn how to create relations between them. You will be taken through organizing, filtering, and sorting your data with collections. You will then learn to enhance an application with new features using events and by creating new observers. Towards the end of the book, you will discover how to install, configure, and use the Eloquent ORM without Laravel. The book concludes by walking you through how to deal with complex problems and build advanced and flexible systems.
