I'm not sure about the number of books I read this year, but I read a good amount. They're mainly self-help books and a few on marketing, so if you're looking for something on web dev or graphic design, then I'm afraid you're out of luck.

## Helping your inner thoughts...

1. [The Chimp Paradox](https://amzn.to/2BG0STf) will help understand and manage your mind. When I struggled with job loss, my mind was all over the place. This book actually helped me understand what was going on, and how to act.
2. [Feel The Fear and do it Anyway](https://amzn.to/2Czdbm1) is another great book. If you're looking to really challenge yourself next year, then I 100% recommend this book. It makes you think what you're really scared of and helps create these thoughts of "What's the worst that could happen?". What's the worst that could happen if you don't do this, and what's the worst that could happen if you actually go through with it?
3. [How to Stop Worrying and Start Living](https://amzn.to/2GEuM03) is another one if you're constantly worrying and just want to live.

## Biggest read of the year...

1. [Tools of Titans](https://amzn.to/2RgG66A) is a meaty book with many gold nuggets. It's recommended you skim through this mammoth and pick up on the little things. You can then use it as a reference book for later in life. It's a book that has is helpful every day.

This is just a small portion of what I have read this year, but I feel they are the most helpful. If you're going through any kind of anxiety or depression then 1 and 2 were at least the biggest helpers for me, and I hope they can be for you. Hopefully next year, the list will be bigger.
