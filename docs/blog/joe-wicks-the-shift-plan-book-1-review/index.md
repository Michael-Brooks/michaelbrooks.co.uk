\> EAT MORE, EXERCISE LESS AND LOSE FAT 'This isn't a strict diet - it's a lifestyle that will transform your body and the way you eat forever.

Joe Wicks has become a loveable character with his charm and witty banter. When I first saw him on Channel 4 (\[Joe Wicks: The Body Coach\](https://www.channel4.com/programmes/joe-wicks-the-body-coach/on-demand/63661-002)), I couldn't help but think how annoying he was, but wow did his food look amazing...

So because of the delicious food on the telly, I became so engrossed that by the end of it, I couldn't help but love him and what he stood for. His mentality in that dieting was wrong and you should eat whole, healthy foods really rung true in my ears.

The next day, I purchased his book (not the one in this review, but the second one in the other review) on Amazon Prime and awaited it's delivery. I then started cooking all sorts of meals which then actually got me to buy his first book.

This book contains a lot more low carbohydrate meals and recommends you to eat 3 low carb meals on a rest day and just 1 high carb meal on a workout day, this works perfectly as I do tend to bloat on carbs anyway.

I can whole heartedly say that I have yet to eat a bad meal from this book and I always look forward to what is next within the day. There are some meals like the chicken pie and Joe's mum's lasagne which I could eat time and time again, and not get bored of at all.

Don't even get me started with breakfast, the overnight oats and the smoothies (nut and mango, and fast-me-up) make me want to jump up out of bed and grab every ingredient needed to wake up and and start my day right.

Now, for the negatives (not many, but definitely important)... The biggest negative, is you really do need to prep like a boss. I know it says it right at the start of the book, but do NOT take this lightly. My partner and I missed a weekly plan at the beginning of our start week and it completely through us off for that entire week. Joe Wicks can not stress enough just how important this is.

Finally, the shopping can get costly, especially at first. It should start balancing out, but just be prepared to splash out a little from the start. If you keep these two negatives in mind then you are definitely good to go and will enjoy every recipe from his book.
