On Saturday the 20th of October, I competed at Battle Cancer alongside 3 of my CrossFit friends; Pete, Phil and Matt. The event had somewhere around 1,000 people attending to watch a range of CrossFit teams compete with one another.

They had teams of males, females and mixed which could either compete at RX or scaled levels. All money raised from ticket sales went to Macmillan Cancer Support. I created my own personal [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/raising-money-for-battle-cancer) to help raise funds for the charity which has raised close to Â£200 so far.

The atmosphere and the crowd were incredible, and we loved every second. The workouts were tough, yet enjoyable. The worst for me was a 50kg med-ball carry. I thought I was going to cry during this, but I held it in and finished the workout.

I have now found some weaknesses that I can improve such as heavy med ball carries, and I will be focusing on this in the future.

Scott and Pete did an incredible job with Battle Cancer, and I can't wait to see it grow even further. Hopefully, the next event I attend will be at Berlin (fingers crossed).
