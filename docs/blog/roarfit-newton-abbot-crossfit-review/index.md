## How I started at Roarfit (Newton Abbot Crossfit)

I've been going to [Roarfit](https://www.weareroarfit.com/) for over 3 years, and I believe a blog review is long overdue. I started going before it was called Roarfit, it started off as [Newton Abbot Crossfit](https://www.newtonabbotcrossfit.com/). When I first started, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. I didn't even know what Crossfit was until I started. It all began because I took my cat to the vets and I saw a bunch of girls and guys flipping tyres. I turned to my wife and said "I want to give this a go", and so I did.

Matt, the owner and first coach of Roarfit (Newton Abbot Crossfit) was very welcoming, he offered an introductory class which tested our strength and endurance. It was mainly running with some easy weight lifting added in. I believe it started off with an 800m run, some kettlebell swings and another 800m run. My mind was like "this is easy, I can do this". Running full pelt at the start, I overtook everyone, and then half way round, I was knackered. It ended up being a jog back, I was too knackered to lift properly and just about survived the last 800m run. The session ended with Matt asking if I would return and my answer was a simple "of course".

## Roarfit is a home from home

Since then, I have been a returning customer ever since. There have been many people coming and going, but the atmosphere within the gym (or box) has remained the same. Everyone is always so welcoming and warming, and we never let anyone suffer alone. Roarfit is a home from home and all the people there are amazing friends and always so supportive. If every gym was like this, then the world would be a much better, safer place.

## Give Roarfit a visit

If you live in Newton Abbot, or you're near the area, then I would recommend you give them a visit. They will be more than welcoming and they'll answer any questions you may have.
