My nephew, wife and I went up to Oldham last weekend to visit my mum. While we were up there, my wife decided to book an hour of Total Ninja in Manchester which was [booked online](http://www.totalninja.co.uk/).

When we arrived, we were told we booked in for aged 4+. We were then given the option to upgrade for an extra Â£2.50 which we did.

The overall experience was amazing. I loved go from one section to another and it gradually getting harder. There were simple jumping platforms, the infamous wall and so much more for you to enjoy. If I failed something, I would go back to the start and try again until giving up and moving on.

Overall, the experience was fantastic and I would love to go again. If you're into Crossfit or obstacle courses, then I would 100% recommend giving this a go. Maybe one day I'll even be on the Ninja Warrior UK TV channel. ?
