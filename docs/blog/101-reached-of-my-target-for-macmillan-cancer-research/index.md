Its been over a week since my colleagues and I completed the Jurassic Hike for Macmillan cancer support. I'm happy to announce that I finished the 26-mile hike and raised a total of £253.44 which is 101% of my target. Together as a team, we all managed to succeed our targets and in total reached 117% of our goal which amounts to £2,045.87.

This is amazing and I'm well and truly shocked and surprised with the amount of donations and support we received for doing this. The whole hike was amazing and I actually made an Instagram post which describes exactly how I felt. Instead of rewriting it, I will share the image below and you can read more.

Thank you so much to everyone who donated, shared and supported our efforts towards such an amazing cause. You are all awesome and I love you all.

I miss the all the conversations I had with my ex colleagues and all the jokes and laughs we had. I think this has been one of my most unforgettable moments (it's a close second to my marriage), and I hope to have many more like this. I also hope I'll be able to share similar moments with the same people again, because they were great to have on such an awesome journey and hopefully more awesome people can join the ride too. This was also done for an amazing cause and the main reason for me going was because my mum suffered with breast cancer twice. Thankfully she survived, but it wasn't without pain, upset and heartache, and others aren't so lucky. I would love it if we could live in a cancer free world. Live, love and laugh because you never know when it's going to be your last day. ♥️](https://www.instagram.com/p/By03g3mlllz/)
