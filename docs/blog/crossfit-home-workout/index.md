This is a bit of a late post and one I had on my mind after completing my home crossfit workout on Monday.

Monday was a bank holiday and for some reason, my Crossfit box closes on bank holidays which means most of us are lost and wonder what to do with ourselves. If the weather is good, he will set a workout in Courtenay Park (Newton Abbot) and will let us bring ourselves, friends and family to participate. However, that Monday wasn't good weather-wise and so he released a home workout for us.

I'm not one for home workouts but thought I would give this one a try.Â  It was two workouts, the first was death by burpees (a workout I had heard about but had never done. I also really struggle with burpees) and the second was 10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3-2-1 reps for time of push-ups, sit-ups and squats.

Overall, it was a fun home workout that I really enjoyed and got a good sweat on. My death by burpees result was 12 rounds plus 6 reps and my time for the second workout was 8 minutes 30 seconds (it could actually be a bit less because my wife walked in as I was working out).

If you're interested in watching my workouts, I recorded and placed them on YouTube which you can conveniently watch below.
