In 4 to 5 days, we will be finding out what our first workout called 19.1 will be. This will be my third year going into the open, and I'm not nervous. The open workouts are just a way for me to see how I stack against my previous self and those within my box. It is nothing more than a benchmark, and I'm sure it's the same for a lot of people. It's always exciting to see athletes compete on top form and they always seem to make it look so easy. I used to think that I could do it like them, but I've learnt I'll never be as good as they are.

This is because I simply don't have the time. If I had the time and money, then sure I would definitely train like them. My goal would go from training for health to training at a competitive level. However, this isn't the case and I'm here to enjoy myself, my training and the competitions I enter.

The atmosphere in each box during this time can be incredible. It can be the most supportive experience anyone will ever witness. Crowds spectating and encouraging their fellow athletes to push through each workout. To truly reach the pinnacle of their fitness during a workout. It's simply amazing, wonderful and exhilirating all in one.
