I've spent this weekend helping my wife looking after 3 dalmatians and 1 lab. They are a handful, but they can also be very well behaved. I got woken up many times during my sleep because they were either begging for a wee or food. It makes me want to have my own dog, but I know it would never be fair on them due to both of us working full-time. Anyway, here are some video snippets of these girls in action. ?
