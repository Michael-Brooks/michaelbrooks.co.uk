For us office workers, today is our first full week back. Like many around this time of year, I felt pretty apprehensive about going back. It was so nice having a break from work and they always go way too fast. Christmas and New Year never last as long as you'd hope and everything just goes back to normal.

This is also the time of year when everyone feels more anxious and/or depressed. If any of your friends/family are feeling low then please offer them support. If you are feeling low and feel like you have no one to talk to, then I'm just a message away.
