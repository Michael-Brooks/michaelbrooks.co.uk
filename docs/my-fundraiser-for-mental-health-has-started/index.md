This is just a quick blog post to let you know I will be starting my first fundraiser for mental health. It will be a Crossfit workout called [Becky](https://wodwell.com/wod/becky/?fbclid=IwAR2RJB6kBMPHduC7NwcN6DWdkw2m9y5he4KbHVXg9Gt3w-MCOT6EXkHGEK0) and all donations will be going to [Mind charity](https://www.mind.org.uk/). I hope you are excited as I am regarding this event, and will join me as the event starts. When more details arise, I will be sure to update you all.
