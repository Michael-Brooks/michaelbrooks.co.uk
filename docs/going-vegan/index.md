Starting tomorrow I will be going vegan. At first, I was very reluctant because I love my meat. I couldn't understand why anyone would want to leave such a good source of food out of their diets. Now after hearing a lot about how farming is a huge cause of global warming, and the need for more animals. We simply won't have enough animals to feed all of us and something needs to be done to sort it.

This post by the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-46865204) explains it better than I could, but you get the idea from me. Anyway, this article had me thinking, and now I'm up for the challenge. I probably won't be a full-blown vegan, as the article suggests, we can still eat meat.

Are you thinking of going vegan? Have any questions you would like answered? Fire away below. ?
