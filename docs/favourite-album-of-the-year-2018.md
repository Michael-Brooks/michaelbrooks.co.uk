This year has been a great year for music releases. We had a surprise album from the amazing Eminem. His album came with a bang and was a great listen for me. Unfortunately, the album was short lived for me, and I have only listened to it a couple of times.

The Prodigy, Tenacious D, Greta Van Fleet are also some marvellous artists that have released some astonishing music. However, for me, my favourite album this year has to be [Mike Shinoda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shinoda)'s Post Traumatic album.

With the death of [Chester Bennington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester_Bennington) on July 2017, Mike had a lot to deal with (along with his other band members, close family and friends). He created an EP of Post Traumatic which spoke about dealing with Chester's death. It was gut-wrenching and emotional.

The full release of the album was spectacular, the later songs were more upbeat, and you could hear a change in his song writing. I wake up to the album every morning during my weekday. It's definitely my most listened to album of the year.

If you have yet to the album, then please give it a try and let me know what you think. If you've already listened to it, then please express how you felt so others can know. ?
