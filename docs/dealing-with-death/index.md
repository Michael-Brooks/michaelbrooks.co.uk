Death is a terrible part of living. We all worry about death, and most of us aren't ready for it when it comes around. If someone passes then those close friends/family feel sadness and mourning and have to deal with so much. Funerals, funding, banking services are just to name a few of the things that have to be dealt with, and it's a terrible situation to go through.

Last Sunday, I found out my best mate's dad had passed away due to a heart attack. He was in hospital beforehand and was given a pacemaker. He was let out of the hospital, but he tried telling them he still didn't feel right. However, as far as they were concerned, he was well enough to go home.

Hearing this from my best friend and hearing the sadness in his voice, left me feeling very sad myself. I didn't know what to say when he spoke and I felt we said goodbye without a good chat. Because of this, I went over to Facebook messenger and told him my true feelings. I love him and his family, his dad was incredible to me and I sent my love and hugs to him and his family. Although I was still sad, I felt better knowing I offered my support to him, obviously, I'm not going to end it there, we sent flowers and a card too.

My wife and I will be attending his funeral this month. It will be nice to see him, his friends and family and to say goodbye and offer our support. I will also tell him he has support on Twitter, as many of my followers sent their love and best wishes.
