This morning's Crossfit workout was a roller-coaster.

21 - 15 - 9 cals/reps (5 minute time cap)

- Assault bike
- Shuttle run

Then...

- Row
- Plate lunges (20kg)

Finally...

- Ski ERG
- Dumbbell snatch (22.5kg)

Because there was such a large number of us in the morning, we had to pair up and one started while the other rested. My partner went first because he wanted to get it out of the way, I was happy to go second so I could watch.

## Playing the long game

I studied how he paced the workout, and he didn't go all out like I normally would. When it came to my turn, I kept a decent pace and finished the bike and row before the 5-minute time cap. I was really happy with this result because I thought I would never finish any of them on time. It then came to the ski ERG and snatch, now I love a good snatch especially with dumbbells. I thought I would be pretty comfortable, but I didn't factor in how bad I would be at the ski. It literally took so much energy out of, to a point where I was shaking. I got the 21 calories down and out and started the snatch. These were lifted pretty comfortably and I thought I might be okay.

## Anxiety building

Then I got back to the ski and oh my god, the struggle was real. My partner helped me push forward and I did everything I could. "Almost there, get back to the snatch" I could hear him shouting. I pushed and pushed, then managed to get out one last snatch before the time ran out. It was tough and a huge mental battle as I could feel the anxiety building up right to the end. After completing the workout, I felt proud of my achievement, the workout was RX'd, and I actually managed to get some good finishing times.
