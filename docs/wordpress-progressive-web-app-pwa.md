# What is a Progressive Web App?

Some of you may be wondering what a PWA actually is, allow me to explain. It's a JavaScript file that uses Web Sockets that performs various tasks. Tasks such as caching your files for faster page loads. Caching also allows a user to view your website even when the user is offline. This means they can still view all of your wonderful content in mobile or broadband blackspots. This does however mean that it won't be up to date until they have an internet connection, but at least they can still view something.

Another thing it does is allow your users to install your website to their phone. This then acts as an app that has a splash screen and loads very quickly.

All of this makes it really easy for your users to view your site time and time again and keeps them engaged for longer. It's a huge win and the way to get it is super simple...

# As easy as 1, 2, 3!

I've recently gotten into the habit of turning my websites into PWAs, it turns out, it is actually fairly straightforward. WordPress has been the most straight forward so far. Simply install [Super PWA](https://superpwa.com/)Â and update the settings of the app.

You can then test this works by using Chrome, pressing F12 on your keyboard clicking "audits" and then performing an audit on your website. It should look something like this...

Congratulations, your website is now a PWA and you should give yourself a pat on the back for all that hard work. Now go tell your users about how great your website is now it's a PWA.
