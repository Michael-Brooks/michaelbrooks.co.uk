Today is apparently blue Monday (I say apparently because of [this post](http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/01/reminder-blue-monday-isnt-real/)). It is also National Hug Day which is a better thing to celebrate. Our workplace decided to celebrate both days anyway, and we came in wearing blue and ready to hug anyone who was willing. ?

Overall, it was a superb day and pretty much like any other day at [Lightfoot](https://www.lightfoot.co.uk/). I mean this in the most positive way too, because we're like a family at Lightfoot. Everyone looks after each other and we try to ensure no one is struggling (mentally or with work). We try to pick each other up when one has fallen and no one dislikes anyone. There are 0 dramas which make days like "Blue Monday" a breeze.

What did you do to help battle Blue Monday, do you partake in National Hug Day? Sound off in the comments below. ?
