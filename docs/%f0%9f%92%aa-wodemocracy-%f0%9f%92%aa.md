I have created a website that I hope can bring a bit more fun and community for all CrossFitters. You can submit a workout of your choice and others can vote on that workout. If yours is the most voted, then it will become the workout of the day, the very next day. If you haven't got a workout, then that's okay, you can vote on other's and encourage them to create more workouts.

This is a fun and simple project I had and wanted to release it out there. It's my first proper project release, because I have always been scared of releasing anything and now is a better time then any!

I ask that you please sign-up and give it a go to see if you can create the next WOD. I also encourage feedback from all my users and would love to hear your thoughts on what works and what doesn't. Email subscriptions will be coming very soon for daily and weekly updates.

The site is [https://wodemocracy.com](https://wodemocracy.com) please check it out and let me know what you think.

Thank you.
